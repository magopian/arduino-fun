## Driving a servo for the Nelson connected device

[Nelson](https://www.fun-mooc.fr/courses/MinesTelecom/04018/session01/about) is
a fun MOOC project. It's a connected device that usually gets orders
(positions) from a remote django server. This experiment is to instead get the
orders from a Kinto server.
